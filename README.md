# Basic Addition Calculator
First time Practicing Node.JS & Express to Create a Calculator

## Description:

I have officially begun learning about Node.JS and Express, through The Complete Web Development Bootcamp, taught by Dr. Angela Yu. I learned that Node.JS frees JavaScript from the Browser and to allow programmers to use JavaScript to interact with the computer directly, with this example having the local computer acting as the server. I learned that Express is a framework for Node.JS, which helps programmers write less repetitive code when building web applications.

In this mini-challenge, I created a server using my local computer using Express, can calculate addition problems for the user. 

## Topics Covered within This Challenge:

1. How to Handle Request and Responses.

2. Learning about and Working with Routes.

3. Using HTML with Node.JS.

4. Using Express within Node.JS, as well as Body Parser within Express.

5. How to assign a Port to my Node.JS Projects and learning that ‚ÄúConsole.Log‚Äù displays within the Terminal.

6. Using Express‚Äôs "Use, Get, Post, Send, and Listen" Methods.

7. How to Concatenate __direname with the desired file. 

## How I Did and my Final Thoughts:

This mini challenge was a lot of fun and I really appreciated learning about Node.JS, Express, and some of what they can do. This challenge also came with a lot of review of commands one can uses within the Terminal. This was a nice refresher as this is the first-time commands are discussed within the Terminal within this course. My only final thoughts are that I am excited to learn more about Node.JS, Express, and more of backend applications. üôÇ
